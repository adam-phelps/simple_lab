# simple_lab
Simple boto3 setup to stand up a defined number of linux servers. This is very helpful for when I am playing around in Linux Academy and want to rapidly provision and destroy some servers without running up a large AWS bill on my personal account.

## helpers folder
Storage for misc scripts and one-liners that are helpful for this.

## lab_config.json
Edit this file as needed to create a dynamic lab setup.
